🛒 **Online Retail Cancellation Prediction**

This project focuses on analyzing online retail customer transactions to **predict order cancellations** using machine learning.


📊 **Overview**

We engineered features from transaction data, segmented customers using **RFM + KMeans**, and applied multiple models to predict cancellations.  
The best-performing models were evaluated over time and interpreted through **feature importance**.


🔧 **Tech Stack**

- **Languages:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Seaborn, Matplotlib  
- **Modeling:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost  
- **Clustering:** KMeans for customer segmentation


⚙️ **Workflow Summary**

- Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering  
- Customer Segmentation (RFM + KMeans)  
- Model Training & Evaluation  
- Hyperparameter Tuning  
- Time-based Model Comparison  
- Feature Importance Analysis


 ✅ **Key Insights**

- **Random Forest** gave the best overall performance  
- Top predictors: `DaysSincePrevPurchase`, `UnitPrice`, and `cluster features`  
- High-value customers with high cancellations require **proactive retention strategies**

---

💡 **Recommendations**

- Monitor customer segments for high cancellation risk  
- Optimize order times and pricing strategies  
- Deploy predictive model for early cancellation alerts
